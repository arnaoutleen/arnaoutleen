# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Introduction

I'm Leen (she/her), a Bioengineering PhD student at the UC Berkeley-UCSF Graduate Program in Bioengineering. I like cats, kendo, and tea. I graduated with a BS in biomedical engineering from Boston University in May 2021. 

I love Boston and will return there as soon as I graduate from Berkeley, no cap.
